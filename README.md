## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
### Favorite Apps and Features

   - Seamless synchronization across devices

### App Idea
I have an idea for a fitness tracking app called "FitTrackr." This app aims to provide users with a holistic approach to health and fitness. One key feature is personalized workout plans based on individual fitness levels, preferences, and goals. Users can track their daily activities, set fitness milestones, and receive real-time feedback on their progress. Additionally, FitTrackr will integrate social features, allowing users to connect with friends for challenges and mutual motivation. The app will also offer nutrition tracking and suggest healthy recipes tailored to the user's dietary preferences. FitTrackr aims to create a supportive community and make the fitness journey enjoyable and sustainable.

## Notes

One challnge I faced was when I had was on Step 3. I was struggling to understand how to change the color when I clicked the button
